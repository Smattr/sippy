# sippy

Sippy is a media centre for resource-constrained machines. It is designed as a
barebones alternative to more heavyweight options like
[XBMC](http://xbmc.org/). It's feature set is deliberately very minimal. Sippy
is basically a full screen file browser.

If you have any problems using sippy, want other features implemented or want
to ask usage questions, feel free to open an issue or email me.
